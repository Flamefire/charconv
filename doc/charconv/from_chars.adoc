== from_chars overview

`from_chars` is a set of functions that parse a string from `[first, last)` in an attempt to convert the string into `value` according to the `chars_format` specified (if applicable).
The result of `from_chars` is `from_chars_result` which on success returns `ptr == last` and `ec == std::errc()`, and on failure returns `ptr` equal to the last valid character parsed or `last` on underflow/overflow, and `ec == std::errc::invalid_argument` or `std::errc::result_out_of_range` respectively.

== from_chars_result
* `ptr` - On return from `from_chars` it is a pointer to the first character not matching the pattern, or pointer to `last` if all characters are successfully parsed.
* `ec` - the error code. Values returned by `from_chars` are:
** `std::errc()` - successful parsing
** `std::errc::invalid_argument` - invalid argument (e.g. parsing a negative number into an unsigned type)
** `std::errc::result_out_of_range` - result out of range (e.g. overflow)
* `operator==` - compares the values of ptr and ec for equality

== from_chars
* `first`, `last` - valid range to parse
* `value` - where the output is stored upon successful parsing
* `base` (integer only) - the integer base to use. Must be between 2 and 36 inclusive
* `fmt` (floating point only) - The format of the buffer. See <<chars_format overview>> for description.

=== from_chars for integral types
* All built-in integral types are allowed except bool which is deleted
* These functions have been tested to support `\__int128` and `unsigned __int128`
* from_chars for integral types is constexpr when compiled using `-std=c++14` or newer
** One known exception is GCC 5 which does not support constexpr comparison of `const char*`.

=== from_chars for floating point types
* On `std::errc::result_out_of_range` we return ±0 for small values (e.g. 1.0e-99999) or ±HUGE_VAL for large values (e.g. 1.0e+99999) to match the handling of `std::strtod`.
This is a divergence from the standard which states we should return the `value` argument unmodified.

** The rationale for this divergence is an open issue with LWG here: https://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/lwg-active.html#3081.
The standard for <charconv> does not distinguish between underflow and overflow like strtod does.
Let's say you are writing a JSON library, and you replace `std::strtod` with `boost::charconv::from_chars` for performance reasons.
Charconv returns std::errc::result_out_of_range on some conversion.
You would then have to parse the string again yourself to figure out which of the four possible reasons you got `std::errc::result_out_of_range`.
Charconv already had this information but could not give it to you.
By implementing the resolution to the LWG issue that matches the established strtod behavior I think we are providing the correct behavior without waiting on the committee's decision.

** If you prefer the handling required by the standard (e.g. value is returned unmodified on `std::errc::result_out_of_range`) use `boost::charconv::from_chars_strict`.
The handling of `std::errc::result_out_of_range` is the only difference between `from_chars` and `from_chars_strict`.

* These functions have been tested to support all built-in floating-point types and those from C++23's `<stdfloat>`
** Long doubles can be 64, 80, or 128-bit, but must be IEEE 754 compliant. An example of a non-compliant, and therefore unsupported, format is `__ibm128`.
** Use of `__float128` or `std::float128_t` requires compiling with `-std=gnu++xx` and linking GCC's `libquadmath`.

=== Basic usage
==== Integral
[source, c++]
----
const char* buffer = "42";
int v = 0;
from_chars_result r = boost::charconv::from_chars(buffer, buffer + std::strlen(buffer), v);
assert(r.ec == std::errc());
assert(r); // Same as above but less verbose. Added in C++26.
assert(v == 42);
----
==== Floating Point
[source, c++]
----
const char* buffer = "1.2345"
double v = 0;
auto r = boost::charconv::from_chars(buffer, buffer + std::strlen(buffer), v);
assert(r.ec == std::errc());
assert(r); // Same as above but less verbose. Added in C++26.
assert(v == 1.2345);

=== Hexadecimal
==== Integral

----
const char* buffer = "2a";
unsigned v = 0;
auto r = boost::charconv::from_chars(buffer, buffer + std::strlen(buffer), v, 16);
assert(r.ec == std::errc());
assert(r); // Same as above but less verbose. Added in C++26.
assert(v == 42);

const char* buffer = "-123";

assert(r.ec == std::errc::invalid_argument);
assert(!r); // Same as above but less verbose. Added in C++26.
----

----
const char* buffer = "-1.573e-3";
double v = 0;
auto r = boost::charconv::from_chars(buffer, buffer + std::strlen(buffer), v, boost::charconv::chars_format::fixed);
assert(r.ec == std::errc::invalid_argument);

const char* buffer = "1234";
unsigned char v = 0;
auto r = boost::charconv::from_chars(buffer, buffer + std::strlen(buffer), v);
assert(r.ec == std::errc::result_out_of_range);
assert(!r); // Same as above but less verbose. Added in C++26.
